# Quizar

The purpose of this application is to know how much the user knows about series and characters. 
There is the possibility to create new questionnaires with different subjects.

# How it works

The app has 3 different layouts:
    - Front layout: Where you can see the available quizes;
    - Quiz Layout: Where you can change the question, the image and the different awnsers;
    - End Quiz Layout: Where the user sees how many points he got.
    
There are 4 Java docs:
    - Main Activity: works with the Front Layout and where you can add more quizes;
    - Quiz_character / Quiz_series: work with the quiz layout and where you can change the questions of each quiz in the listQuestions() function;
    - End Quiz: interacts with the End Quiz Layout.
    
# What can be worked on

  - Add more quizes;
  - Store the scores of the user;
  - Add more themes;
  - Add a clock.
